I’m excited to share a deep dive into my latest **Medicines Development and Supply (MDS) Business Analytics Project**! Using **Python** and **Power BI**, **Excel**, I analyzed pharmaceutical data to derive actionable insights, supporting drug development and decision-making processes for MDS. Below are the key highlights of my work:

🔍 **Data Collation & Preparation**:
- Combined datasets from cardiovascular, neurology, oncology, diabetes, and infectious disease departments.
- Merged multiple CSV files to create a comprehensive dataset with details on drug development phases, regulatory statuses, patient enrollments, and market potential.

📊 **Visualization & Dashboards**:
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Developed dynamic dashboards showcasing development costs, durations, and success rates across therapeutic areas.
- Visualized **Supply Chain Issues**, highlighting major bottlenecks and their cost impact.
- Mapped **Market Potential of Drugs** by phase and therapeutic area using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

📈 **Data Analytics**:
- Modeled **Average Development Time & Cost** by phase (pre-clinical, Phase I–III, approval) and therapeutic area.
- Identified high-potential drugs pending approval with market potential over $500M.
- Evaluated **Drug Success Rates** by therapeutic area, showcasing top-performing research sites.
- Calculated **Time to Market** for approved drugs and **Projected Market Impact** using a weighted success factor.

📉 **Advanced Analysis**:
- Correlated development duration with success rates, revealing key insights into phase efficacy.
- Created predictive models to forecast drug market success, using factors like clinical trial outcomes and projected ROI.

💡 **Key Takeaways**:
- Leveraged Python’s **pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visual insights, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.
- Gained a thorough understanding of pharmaceutical business operations, from drug development costs to regulatory status impact.

This project truly expanded my skills in **data visualization**, **predictive modeling**, and **business analytics** while offering a real-world scenario within the pharmaceutical industry.
